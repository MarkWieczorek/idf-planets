Paris and the surrounding region of Ile-de-France host a large number of scientists and engineers in the field of planetary science. We are not all located at the same place, but are instead spread across several different laboratories, sites, and institutional structures. No single portal exists for promoting our research and academic programs to students, to early career scientists, nor to the public.

The goals of **Ile-de-France Planets** are to
* Aid in fostering interactions among the planetary scientists and engineers who work within the region of Ile-de-France,
* Promote the attractivity of doing research in Ile-de-France to students, postdocs, and early career scientists,
* Improve the visibility of the planetary science seminars that are held within our laboratories,
* Facilitate the advertisement of master and Ph.D. thesis topics, post-doc positions, and job openings within our research groups, and to
* Promote our research to the general public.

Through this web site, we aim to provide a general overview of the planetary science research groups, researchers, and academic programs that are located in Ile-de-France. To this end, we have created email lists and public calendars for general announcements and the advertisement of seminars. We have created a mastodon account for disseminating the result of our research. And we have created a public forum where members of the planetary science community can interact.

This initiative is driven entirely by the planetary science community and is not affiliated with any particular organization within Ile-de-France. We depend entirely on volunteers in developing this web site. If you would like to get involved, or simply have comments on how things could be improved, please get in touch with us!
