Paris and the surrounding region of Ile-de-France host a large number of researchers in the field of planetary science. However, we are spread across several different laboratories, sites, and institutional structures, and this is not always conducive for promoting interactions and the development of collaborations within this community. Though geographical and institutional barriers contribute to this problem, one of the main barriers is simply the lack of information about what is occurring in other research groups.

The goals of **Ile-de-France Planets** are to
* Aid in fostering interactions among the planetary scientists who work within the region of Ile-de-France,
* Facilitate the advertisement of master and Ph.D. thesis topics, post-doc positions, and job openings within our research groups,
* Improve the visibility of the planetary science seminars that are held within our laboratories, and to
* Promote the attractivity of doing research in Ile-de-France to students, postdocs, and early career scientists.

We are experimenting with several initiatives to achieve these goals. Some of these include the creation of email lists for general announcements and advertising seminars, the creation of a calendar of seminars and events, and the creation of public forums where you can discuss with your colleagues online.

This initiative is driven entirely by the planetary science community and is not affiliated with any particular organization within Ile-de-France. With no budget, we depend entirely on volunteers in developing this web site, advertising seminars, the writing of newsletters, and so on. If you would like to get involved, or simply have comments on how things could be improved, please contact us on one of the forums or by email!
