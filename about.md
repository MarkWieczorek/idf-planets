Paris and the surrounding region of Ile-de-France host a large number of researchers in the field of planetary science. However, we are spread across several different laboratories, sites, and institutional structures, and this is not always conducive for promoting interactions within this community, nor to promoting our research and academic programs to students and early career scientists. Though geographical and institutional barriers contribute to this problem, one of the main barriers is simply the lack of information about what is occurring in other research groups.

The goals of **Ile-de-France Planets** are to
* Aid in fostering interactions among the planetary scientists who work within the region of Ile-de-France,
* Promote the attractivity of doing research in Ile-de-France to students, postdocs, and early career scientists,
* Improve the visibility of the planetary science seminars that are held within our laboratories, and to
* Facilitate the advertisement of master and Ph.D. thesis topics, post-doc positions, and job openings within our research groups.

We are experimenting with several initiatives to achieve these goals. Through this web site, we aim to provide more information about the planetary science research groups, researchers, and academic programs that are located in Ile-de-France. We have created email lists and public calendars for general announcements and the advertisement of seminars. We have created as mastodon account for disseminating the result of our research. And we have created public forum where members of the planetary science community can interact.

This initiative is driven entirely by the planetary science community and is not affiliated with any particular organization within Ile-de-France. We depend entirely on volunteers in developing this web site, advertising seminars, the writing of newsletters, and so on. If you would like to get involved, or simply have comments on how things could be improved, please get in touch with us!
