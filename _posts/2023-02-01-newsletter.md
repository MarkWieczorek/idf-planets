Welcome to the Ile-de-France Planets Newsletter for the month of February! We will keep this short.

## News
* We have started to provide more information about the research labs in Ile-de-France on [this web page](https://www.ile-de-france-planets.fr/research-labs.html). In particular, we are adding (1) a link to the group website, (2) a short list of research themes, (3) a list of permanent researchers working in planetary science, and (4) a physical address so that people can find your lab. If you would like to provide this information for your lab (or make changes), please contact us. So far, we have information for about 1/3 of the research labs.
* We have created a new web page to provide more information about the [students, postdocs, and permanent researchers working in Ile-de-France](https://www.ile-de-france-planets.fr/people.html). If you would like to appear in this list, please fill out [this form](https://framaforms.org/ile-de-france-planetary-scientists-1672918633). You only need to provide your name, lab name, a couple research keywords, and a link to your personal web page. As soon as we have a critical mass of responses, we will update this page.
* If you would like to advertise your seminars, please send us your seminar list before the first of the month. If you are late, you can send this information yourself to this list directly. And if you happen to be the person in charge of your seminar series, please contact us and we will give you access to modify our online calendar.
* And lastly, we are looking for someone to help with making some graphics, logos, etc., for publicizing Ile-de-France Planets. If you are good with this sort of thing, please get in touch!
