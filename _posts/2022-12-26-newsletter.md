Hello world! This is the first newsletter of the Ile-de-France Planets community. We will try to keep these short.

## News
Since starting this initiative about a month ago, we have set up a few online resources:
* We now have a simple web site: [www.ile-de-france-planets.fr](https://www.ile-de-france-planets.fr/). It should only take you a few minutes to go through all the text, so please let us know if you have any comments or suggestions. In particular, please let us know if your laboratory is missing from the list! In the next month we will add more information about each lab, including research themes, staff, and location.
* We have set up an RSS feed for news and announcements that are posted on the web site (such as for this newsletter).
* We have created a [Github organization](https://github.com/idf-planets) that hosts the web site. The easiest way to make changes is to open a pull request!
* We have set up a [mastodon account](https://astrodon.social/@IDF_Planets) on the astrodon.social server. You can post to this account, or have your posts automatically boosted by this account. See the web site for instructions on how our Mastodon bot works.
* We have set up two forums for online discussions: one using [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#IDF-Planets:matrix.org) and the other [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/idf_planets). If you would like to use a different platform, please create the forum and we will add it to the list!
* And lastly, we have set up two email lists and a shared calendar for seminars and events. If there is a need, we can create more. Instructions for how to access these are in the web site.

*If you would like administrator access for any of the above accounts, please let us know!*

## Deadlines
