Welcome to the Ile-de-France Planets Newsletter for the month of April!

## Updates
* The Ile-de-France Planets [web site](https://www.ile-de-france-planets.fr) is now in an almost final and stable state. Thanks to everyone who helped and contributed! If you haven't looked at it recently, now would be the time to do so. We are still open to suggestions on how it can be improved, but we don't expect to make any major changes at this point.
* Almost all of the [research labs in Ile-de-France](https://www.ile-de-france-planets.fr/research-labs.html) are listed along with their groups, members, and research themes. There are still a couple groups missing: If you are one of them, it is never too late to provide us with the information we asked.
* And lastly, if you would like your name to appear in the list of active researchers, postdocs and students working in Ile-de-France, please fill out the form at the bottom of [this page](https://www.ile-de-france-planets.fr/people.html).

The Titan Through Time workshop is an important venue for the Titan research community to exchange research results and ideas about the Titan Science System. The 6th workshop will be held June 13-15 at the Université Paris Cité, Campus Grands Moulins. The abstract submission deadline is April 15.

* [Ph.D. topic: Simulation of Martian Ground Ice](http://planeto.geol.u-psud.fr/spip.php?action=acceder_document&arg=1042&cle=71fa770ce8bc9495a9cc9ab24efba73a5cde5b85&file=pdf/MarsGroundIce_PhD.pdf). The project aims to significantly advance our understanding of very shallow ground ice on Mars, which has been found to be much more widespread than once thought.
