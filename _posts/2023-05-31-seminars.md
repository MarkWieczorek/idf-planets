**Resurfacing and texturing of rubble-pile minor planets**<br />
Ishan SHARMA (Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur)<br />
IPGP Planetary and Space Sciences, Bâtiment Lamarck B, 35 rue Hélène Brion, Paris

<b>Summary</b><br />
Many asteroids, small moons and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are now thought to be rubble piles, i.e. granular aggregates that are held together mainly by their self-gravity. The study of their dynamics and physics thus necessitates an investigation into the mechanics of self-gravitating and rotating granular aggregates in space. I will present some of our recent work into the processes by which the surfaces of such objects may be reshaped and textured by landslides and seismic shaking that may be induced by impact events.

**Thermal Tides in the Martian Atmosphere**<br />
Siteng FAN (Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique, LMD)<br />
IPGP Planetary and Space Sciences, Bâtiment Lamarck B, 35 rue Hélène Brion, Paris

<b>Summary</b><br />
Atmospheric thermal tides are planetary-scale harmonic responses driven by diurnal solar forcing and influenced by planetary topography. As results of solar heating absorbed directly by the atmosphere and exchanged with the surface, thermal tides in the Martian atmosphere usually have large amplitudes due to its low heat capacity, and dominate the diurnal temperature variations throughout the thin atmosphere. In this talk, I will present results of the analysis of thermal tides and their seasonal variations using temperature profiles retrieved from infrared spectra obtained by the TIRVIM Fourier-spectrometer, part of the Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS) onboard the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and the Emirates Mars InfraRed Spectrometer (EMIRS) instrument onboard the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) Hope spacecraft. Design of non-Sun-synchronous orbits of these spacecrafts enable the analysis of diurnal temperature variations with a full local time coverage obtained within a short period of time. Wave mode decomposition is applied to these diurnal variations to derive the tide amplitudes and phases. The results show good agreements with predictions made by the Mars Planetary Climate Model (PCM), previously known as the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (LMD) Mars Global Circulation Model (GCM), except for decent differences in phases. Possible tide excitation sources are also examined through a series of sensitivity tests using Mars PCM. This work provides valuable information on understanding physical processes in the Martian atmosphere on a diurnal scale.

**Ring moon morphology and libration measurements**<br />
Nicolas Rambaux (Sorbonne Université, IMCCE-Observatoire de Paris)<br />
IPGP Planetary and Space Sciences, Bâtiment Lamarck B, 35 rue Hélène Brion, Paris

<b>Summary</b><br />
The Cassini-Huygens space mission made a series of observations of Saturn’s small satellites during its grand finale stage. This talk will discuss the shape analysis of the small Saturnian satellites in order to describe their global figure and large-scale topography, as well as to deduce fundamental quantities, gravity field, and amplitude of the diurnal libration by assuming that the bodies are homogeneous. These predicted librations are then compared with recent measurements obtained by astrometry to discuss the internal structure of such bodies.
