Welcome to the Ile-de-France Planets Newsletter for the month of March! We will keep this short.

## Updates
* We have created a new web page listing the various planetary science [Master and Ph.D. programs](https://www.ile-de-france-planets.fr/study.html) in Ile-de-France. Please let us know if we are missing any.
* We have created a new page [In the News](https://www.ile-de-france-planets.fr/in-the-news.html) that links to news articles and press releases related to research activities in Ile-de-France. The next time you find your work in the news, please let us know so that we can advertise it!
* We have published a new web page to promote the [students, postdocs, and permanent researchers](https://www.ile-de-france-planets.fr/people.html) working in Ile-de-France. If you would like to appear in this list with a link to your webpage, please fill out [this form](https://framaforms.org/ile-de-france-planetary-scientists-1672918633): It will only take you 2 minutes.
* And finally, we are progressing on our goal to provide more information about each [research lab](https://www.ile-de-france-planets.fr/research-labs.html) in Ile-de-France. We are about 85% there with only 3 missing, so if you are part of AIM or IMCCE, or IMPMP-COSMO, please get in touch with us! It should only take about 5 minutes of your time.
