# Ile-de-France Planets

We are a community of planetary scientists that works in Paris and the surrounding region of Ile-de-France. Our goals are to

* Aid in fostering interactions among the planetary scientists who work within the region of Ile-de-France,
* Facilitate the advertisement of master and Ph.D. thesis topics, post-doc positions, and job openings within our research groups,
* Improve the visibility of the planetary science seminars that are held within our laboratories, and
* Promote the attractivity of doing research in Ile-de-France to students, postdocs, and early career scientists.
