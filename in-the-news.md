					<h3>Hayabusa 2</h3>

				<p><b>January 23, 2023.</b> A new study of samples brought back from the Ryugu asteroid by the JAXA mission Hayabusa 2 helped to characterize and map different types of carbonate minerals within the samples. A near-infrared hyperspectral microscope developed by IAS has been analyzing the entire collection of samples. Hundreds of carbonate-rich zones were detected, including small carbonate-rich grains and carbonate-rich inclusions within larger grains, that formed within the first millions of years of evolution of our Solar System.</p>
